// Your HTML and JavaScript are focused on handling events and manipulating the DOM, which is a great way to understand JavaScript event handling. Here's a breakdown of what you've done, followed by interview practice questions and some key notes for event handling in JavaScript.

// Breakdown of the Code:
// Event Delegation: You’re using event delegation, where a single event listener on the parent element (#images) handles the click events for all its child elements (<img> tags). This is efficient because you don't need to add individual event listeners to each image.

// e.target: This refers to the actual element that was clicked. In your case, when an image is clicked, the event listener identifies the clicked element by checking if e.target.tagName is 'IMG'.

// DOM Manipulation: When an image is clicked, the corresponding <li> element is removed from the DOM by calling removeIt.remove().

// Preventing Default Behavior: You’ve commented out a part where e.preventDefault() stops the default action (in case of a link click), which is important when you want to handle custom behaviors.

// Key JavaScript Event Concepts (Notes):
// Event Listeners: Use addEventListener to attach an event handler to an element.


element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    // Handle the event
}, false);


// Event Object (event): When an event is triggered, an event object is passed to the handler, providing details such as:

// target: The element that triggered the event.
// currentTarget: The element to which the event handler is attached.
// preventDefault(): Prevents the default action of the event (e.g., link navigation).
// stopPropagation(): Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
// type: Type of the event (e.g., 'click', 'keydown').
// timestamp: Time the event was created.
// Event Delegation: Attach one event listener to a parent element to manage events for multiple child elements. It improves performance, especially for dynamic content.

// Event Bubbling: Events propagate from the innermost element (target) to the outermost elements in the DOM. Use e.stopPropagation() to stop this behavior if necessary.

// Common Events:

// click: Triggered when an element is clicked.
// keydown: Triggered when a key is pressed.
// mouseover: Triggered when the mouse enters an element.
// submit: Triggered when a form is submitted.
// Interview Practice Questions on JavaScript Events:
// What is event delegation and why is it used?

// Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to manage events triggered by its child elements. It's efficient because it avoids attaching individual event listeners to each child, improving performance, especially when the child elements are dynamically added or removed.
// Explain preventDefault() and stopPropagation(). When would you use them?

// preventDefault() stops the default action associated with an event, like preventing a link from navigating. stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements. These are useful when you want custom behavior (e.g., when you want to intercept a form submission or prevent a click event from reaching parent elements).
// What’s the difference between target and currentTarget in an event?

// target refers to the element that triggered the event (the actual element clicked), while currentTarget refers to the element that the event listener is attached to.
// What are some common event types in JavaScript?

// Some common event types include click, mouseover, keydown, submit, focus, and load.
// How can you remove an event listener?

// You can remove an event listener using the removeEventListener method.
// javascript
// Copy code
// element.removeEventListener('click', handlerFunction);
// How would you handle events for dynamically added elements?

// You would use event delegation. By attaching an event listener to a parent element, you can capture events for dynamically added children by checking the target in the event object.
// Additional Practice Task:
// Try to extend your current learning by:

// Implementing a feature where, instead of removing the image when clicked, it changes to a different image by modifying its src attribute.

// Example:

document.querySelector('#images').addEventListener('click', function(e){
    if (e.target.tagName === 'IMG') {
        e.target.src = "https://new-image-url.com"; // Change to a different image
    }
});
// By continuing to explore event handling and DOM manipulation, you'll become more comfortable with these crucial JavaScript concepts.
